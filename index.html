            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of eLearning companies starting out right now. What makes us different
            is that we are not about selling content. Most companies fragment the educational world further.
            We want to unite people on their road to a better education and empower them to help each
            other out, creating content for each other.<br>
            We want to open up the priced possessions of the world's best schools, much like Aristotle did thousands
            of years ago. We are not building paywalls, we are tearing them down. Because basic education should be free
            but also getting higher in quality.<br>
            We want to create a world in which teachers can focus on answering questions instead of repeating the same
            talk they've repeated over the last 20 years. A world in which students can prepare more efficiently and
            better paced than ever before.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            <p><b>Good news!</b> Aristotle is free because we want to bring
                education to the entire world. There might be a time
                when we allow for teachers to earn money by providing content. But
                for now, it's free contribution and free usage.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>What people are saying</h3>
            <p>Diana S., student: "This is a great platform that has greatly helped me improve on my study process"</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Future Roadmap</h3>
            <p>Create certificates that are internationally accredited.<br>
            manage courses, students and grades<br>
            create crowdsourced study materials. Coursebooks, etc...</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>How are we different from education providers?</h3>
            <p>We don't offer courses, etc.
                Instead we "croudsource" the collection and rating of existing material.
                Our platform links to all those content providers and universities.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Who makes Aristotle?</h3>
            <p>We are a team of experienced web developers, PhD grads and award-winning educational software creators<br>
